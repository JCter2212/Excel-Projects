Bike Sales Excel Analysis

Notes:
1. This project shows two methods of data cleaning: manual and macro driven. 

	Manual:
	Data cleaning was conducted using manually in the following ways:
	1. All columns were selected and the Remove Duplicates feature was removed to delete duplicate entries. 
	2. Find-and-Replace to update clear up ambiguity in the Marital Status and Gender columns. 
	3. Income was changed to a currency type column. 
	4. Find-and-Replace was used to udpat the Commute Distance value "10+ miles" for ease of analysis. 
	5. An Age Group column was created using the IFS formula to create groups for ease of analysis.
	6. The range was converted to a table for ease of generating pivot tables and pivot charts. 

	Macro:
	The data cleaning macro is currently embedded in the Data (Base) tab. It conducts all of the manual functions, but does not create a table.
	In lieu of running the macro, the code as been placed as a text file with the project.
